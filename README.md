# PaintballAppApi

This is an API made for my Angular project Paintball Arena

I use mongo atlas in order to store the data, but a local version of MongoDB works as well


## How to get it up and running

1.Clone the repository and run npm install ;
2. Create a .env file in the main directory
3. Add the following variables there:
DB_USER= 
DB_PASS=
DB_NAME=
URL= this is the MongoDB connection url
PRIVATE_KEY= needed for bcrypt
SALT_ROUNDS= needed for bcrypt
EMAIL_USER= needed for the use of the email sending functionality;  must be an email created with hotmail
EMAIL_PASSWORD= needed for the use of the email sending functionality; 
4.Start the server with npm start ;
